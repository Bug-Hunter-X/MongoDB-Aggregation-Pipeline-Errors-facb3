# MongoDB Aggregation Pipeline Errors
This repository demonstrates common errors encountered while using MongoDB's aggregation pipeline, specifically focusing on issues arising from incorrect field names and missing requirements in pipeline stages.

## Bug Description
The provided code snippet shows an aggregation pipeline that aims to group documents, count occurrences, sort by count, and limit the result set. However, potential errors can occur if the `fieldName` in the `$group` stage is misspelled or if the `$match` stage lacks necessary filters to narrow down the documents appropriately.  This can result in an empty or incorrect result set.

## Solution
The solution involves careful review and correction of the aggregation pipeline.  This includes double-checking field names for accuracy, ensuring the `$match` stage includes all required filtering conditions, and testing the pipeline thoroughly with sample data.

## How to reproduce
1. Create a MongoDB collection with sample documents.
2. Run the provided buggy aggregation query.
3. Observe the incorrect or empty output.
4. Run the corrected query from the solution file.
5. Observe the correct output.
